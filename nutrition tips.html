                        Nutrition is a very important part of staying fit and healthy, this is because it provide the energy and resources needed for your body to stay maintained and in top shape.
                        A few tips for eating the most nutritional foods include:
                        - Avoiding ultra processed foods
                        - Eat nuts and seeds
                        - Eat protein in every meal
                        - Try to drink 1.2 litres of water per day.
                        - Make sure to eat lots of fruit and veg
                        Food is a central theme in all cultures. Traditional cuisine is passed down from one generation to the next and we often associate family food gatherings from our childhood with delightful, enticing odors seeping from the kitchen stovetop and oven.
                        Today we are able to readily enjoy food from all parts of the world and create recipes that reflect various cultures. However, the modernization of food preparation, coupled with our fast-paced lifestyles, has resulted in the increase in processed and fast foods. 
                        It's recommended that men have around 2,500 calories a day (10,500 kilojoules). Women should have around 2,000 calories a day (8,400 kilojoules).
