                        Eating healthily can be made easier by using a meal plan, whether its a plan made by you or if its a plan made by a company, it doesnt matter, as log as you have a plan of some kind. 
                        Two services I would recommend are HelloFresh and Mindful Chef. HelloFresh offers a very diverse menu with alot of flexiblity and diversity, allowing for all people to use their service. HelloFresh provides a top quality service with fresh ingredients and recipes delivered straight to your door, making dinner easier to cook and staying healthy even easier.
                        Mindful Chef provides a very good service with no meals that contain refined carbs like pasta, bread or white rice. Mindful Chef also has multiple different portion sizes for different size families, making deciding for dinner even easier, all of the recipes are gluten free and have benefits to people other than the buyer, as each meal bought donates one of the same meal to a child in poverty and invests in regenerative farming practices.
