                        Exercise is a very important part of getting into shape, whether you do this by going to the gym or by doing physical activities like swimming, running or walking it doesnt matter, what matters is that you do something, if you dont like to go outside then a good way to get some exercise in is by playing fitness games like "Ring Fit Adventure" on the Nintendo Switch. Another way is to do a push up every time you die in a difficult game like Dark Souls or Elden Ring.
                        Exercising can provide many benefits other than making you more attractive, it helps reduce weight, it can improve your strength and help you grow, it can develop muscles and the cardiovascular system to help you keep your breath for longer while exercising.
