                    <p>To eat healthily then the 8 most basics things you can do are:
                        1. Eat more meals with high fibre and starchy carbs.
                        2. Make sure to include fruit or veg with all of your meals.
                        3. Eat more fish, even some oily fish.
                        4. Eat less fatty foods and sugar.
                        5. Eat no more than 6g of salt for adults.
                        6. Start being more active, this would include walking more or just going to places like a gym and working out for a bit.
                        7. Make sure to keep yourself hydrated.
                        8. Make sure that you always eat breakfast.
                        Doing all of these steps will ensure that your body is getting the nutrition that it requires for maintainance and exercise. Making your life easier and losing weight feel like a breeze.
                        It's recommended that you eat at least 5 portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables every day. They can be fresh, frozen, canned, dried or juiced.
                        There's evidence that people who eat at least 5 portions of fruit and vegetables a day have a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and some cancers.
                        Starchy foods should make up just over a third of everything you eat. This means your meals should be based on these foods.
                        Choose wholegrain or wholemeal varieties of starchy foods, such as brown rice, wholewheat pasta, and brown, wholemeal or higher fibre white bread.
                        They contain more fibre, and usually more vitamins and minerals, than white varieties.
                        Potatoes with the skins on are a great source of fibre and vitamins. For example, when having boiled potatoes or a jacket potato, eat the skin too.
