                        Having a good sleep schedule can provide many benefits to your health such as:
                        Improving your attention and concentration. Learn and make memories. Helps you maintain a healthy weight. Keep your heart healthy. Keep your immune system strong. Looks after your emotional and mental wellbeing. Reduce your stress levels. Maintain good relationships.
                        Maintaining a healthy sleep schedule will require you to go to bed at around 10pm or earlier and waking up with plenty of time in the morning so that you arent stressing about being late to work or school.
                        Its no surprise that getting a good nights sleep can help to keep your energy levels up. But plenty of rest can also help to keep your mind from wandering, and maintain your attention throughout the day.
                        Not sleeping properly can mean that both your body and brain dont function properly the next day. It could affect your attention span, concentration, strategic thinking, assessment of risk and your reaction times. This is really important if you have a big decision to make, are driving, or are operating heavy machinery, because sleep deprivation makes you more likely to make a mistake or have an accident. But getting plenty of sleep can help you to stay sharp and focused all day long.
                        Not only does sleep allow your body the time it needs to rest, repair and rebuild, but it does the same for your mind too. As you sleep, your brain begins to organise and process all the information youve taken on during the day. It converts your short-term memories into long-term memories. This helps you to learn and means that when you wake up, you can often see things more clearly.
                        Although more research is needed to fully understand how sleep affects your weight, some studies have shown that getting enough sleep can help you to maintain a healthy weight.
                        If youre not sleeping properly, your body will need more energy because its awake for longer. But youre more likely to overeat and choose foods that are high in calories later in the day. Its also thought that being sleep-deprived could increase your appetite, because it changes the level of hormones that signal hunger and fullness in your body. Not only that, but if youre feeling tired, it might also mean you have less energy to exercise. So getting enough sleep could help you to maintain a healthy weight.
                        A lack of sleep can increase your risk of developing high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary heart disease and stroke. When you sleep, your heart rate and blood pressure naturally drop, to allow your heart time to rest and recover. But research has shown that if youre not sleeping properly, your sympathetic nervous system remains stimulated at night. This is the system of your body responsible for the fight-or-flight response how your body reacts when it senses danger. This means your heart rate and blood pressure dont go down at night if youre awake, and your body releases stress hormones that keep you alert. And if your blood pressure remains up at night, youre more likely to have high blood pressure during the day.
